# Webb Swerve Lib
During the 2025 REEFSCAPE game, Team 1466 gained interest in an intelligent autonomous pathing system built from the ground up. Webb Swerve Lib is a WIP library built from the ground up for controlling a swerve drive.
## Key Features
- ### Simulation Support:
-   Everything done by this library supports simulation, including the Swerve Drive, the Vision System (Using PhotonVision) and any other subsystems.
- ### Vision Implementation:
-   As mentioned, this project uses PhotonVision to fuse the odometry estimation with the vision pose estimation for the most accurate pose estimation
- ### Fully custom Autonomous System along with Teleop autonomous navigating
